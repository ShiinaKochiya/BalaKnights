# BalaKnights

When the Doctor went all in Jesselton

A simple Balatro mod, adding a few Jokers and Deck based on Arknights characters. Plan how to play your cards wisely, it ends sooner than you think

## Requirements:
- [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) (Of course every Balatro mod need Steamodded)

## What this mod added:
- 3 Jokers:
  + Queen of Babel: Gain permanent flat amount of Mults per Queen in hand
  + PRTS: Gain permanent xMult per Kings and Queens played and scored, after which destroy the cards
  + Amiya: Give flat amount of Chips, gain extra Chips per discarded Kings. If the first discarded hand only contain a single King, create a copy of that card and draw to hand
- 1 Deck:
  + Rhodes Island deck: Starts with triple the amount of face cards, with an Eternal Negative PRTS Joker

## How to install mod (Windows):
1. Make sure that Steamodded is installed and running
2. Navigate to `%appdata%` and find .`/Balatro `
3. If there isn't a folder name "Mods", create one. Download the repo or clone via Git to the "Mods" folder (if should look something like `./Mods/BalaKnights`)

## DISCLAIMER:
- The mod is somehow (I dunno) not compatibile with Cryptid/Talisman, turn off these mods before playing so the game won't crash
