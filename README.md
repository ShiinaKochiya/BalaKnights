# BalaKnights

When the Docter went all in Jesselton

A simple Balatro mod, adding a few Jokers and Deck based on Arknights characters. Rational your cards, it ends sooner than you think

## Requirements:
- [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) (ofcourse every Balatro need Steamodded)

## What this mod added:
- 3 Jokers:
  + Queen of Babel: Gain permanent flat amount of Mults per Queen in hand
  + PRTS: Gain permanent xMult per Kings and Queens played and scored, after which destroy the cards
  + Amiya: Still in development. For now it give x30 Mult with no condition
- 1 Deck:
  + Rhodes Island deck: Starts with triple the amount of face cards, with an Eternal Negative PRTS Joker

## How to install mod:
1. Make sure that Steamodded is installed and running
2. Navigate to `%appdata%` and find .`/Balatro `
3. If there isn't a folder name "Mods", create one. Download the repo or clone via Git to the "Mods" folder (if should look something like `./Mods/BalaKnights`)
